/* Comments in JavaScript are used for a variety of reasons, the most popular one being to "document" code.  */
/* There are two types of JS Comments: Single-line and Multi-line commenting. */
// This is an example of a single-line comment. It is written with two forward slashes. Whatever text/code comes after it is commented out.
/* 

  Multi-line comments begin with a forward slash and an aesterisk and end with an aesterisk and forward slash.
  
  As the name suggests, multi-line comments can be written out on multiple lines. Code or text within the opening and closing forward slashes
  will not be executed by the javascript engine when it's parsing the script.
