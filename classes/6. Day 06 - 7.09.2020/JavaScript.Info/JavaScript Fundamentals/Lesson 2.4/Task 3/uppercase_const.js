/*

  Uppercase Const
  
  Instructions:
  
  Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?
  
  const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make uppercase?
  const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make uppercase?
  
  Response:
  
  => const BIRTHDAY should be uppercase as the value of the constant is "hard-coded".
  => const age on the other hand, should not be uppercase as the value of the constant is not hard-coded, rather it's calculated in run-time or on-the-fly.
