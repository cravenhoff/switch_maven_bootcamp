/*

  => Creating Arrays
  Arrays are created like any other ordinary variable. The only difference is that arrays are distinguished using the square bracket symbol: []. Within the square bracket, array elements are added, each of which is separated by a comma.

// Create a fruits array
let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "pair", "banana"];
