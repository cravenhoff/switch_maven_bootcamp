      <p>After fighting through the besieged city, Badger Squad locates the demo team, who were killed by the North Koreans, and decide to continue their mission. Being covered by Cormack and Jackson, Will and Mitchell proceed towards the Mobile Launcher and succeed in planting the demolition charge, although Will's arm is broken by a shutter panel and is unable to get free. Not wanting them both to die, Will sacrifices himself and throws Mitchell off the ascending Launcher, being killed in the ensuing explosion. Mitchell loses his left arm due to a piece of shrapnel severing it but is saved by Sergeant Cormack, who promises to get Mitchell home. The mission is successful as the U.S. are able to repel the North Korean attack, but at a massive cost: 6000 Marines are killed.</p><hr>
