  => JavaScript Functions
  JavaScript deals with different types of functions, but more often in your programming career, you are likely to come across the two common ones listed below:
  1. Functions
  2. Recursions
  
  => Functions
  Functions in JavaScript are essentially "sub-programs" that group relatable code together and provide a clean, repeatable method for executing a single feature or operation in an application. In short, a JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
  Functions are created using the "function" keyword, accept inputs through the use of parameters, and have a return value, either explicity stated or not (in this case, the function returns a value of "undefined" by default.
  Functions are called by using their name, followed by parenthesis. This is called "invoking" a function, which instructs the JavaScript engine to "process" or "execute" the code within the functions curly braces.

 JavaScript provides the following types of functions:
 1. Named Functions
